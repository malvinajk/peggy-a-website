## Overview

This project is an interactive portfolio display for a client that arranges project titles in an ellipse layout. Users can scroll to rotate the ellipse, focus on individual projects and view a larger title in the center.

It demonstrates:
 - Dynamic layout using vanilla JavaScript;
 - Smooth animations with GSAP (MotionPathPlugin + ScrollTrigger)
 - Responsive ellipse geometry;
 - Dynamic image / title focus logic;

## Features
- Scroll based rotation of the ellipse;
- Highlight/focus effect for selected project;
- Dynamic title display in the center;
- Supports different background types with adaptive text color;

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6) for interactive logic and DOM manipulation;
- GSAP for animations, motion path and scroll trigger
- HTML / CSS for responsive layout and styling
- Vite for fast development
